KeyWord in Context visualization using Sigma.js

It's not a typical KWIC-listing, see. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context
instead it visualizes a hierarchical structure of "keyword super class" > keyword > keyword context. 
By clicking a nodes the user can transition to the appropriate view state.   
It's up to the user to supplement the visualization with correct data but phrase/context nodes should normally include the keyword.
